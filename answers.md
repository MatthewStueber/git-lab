1) git version 2.17.1

2)user.name=MatthewStueber

3) When git --help is inputted into the terminal the operating system gives a whole bunch of commands that start with usage of git then goes to the "these are common Git commands used in various situations:" then goes on to list the commands and what they do.

4) the terminal states "On branch master" next line "No commits yet" next line "Untracked files:" then lists the names of the .md files (README and answers).

5) After checking the status of the directory in the terminal the terminal states that I am on the branch master with no commits yet and changes to be committed and it says i have a new file: README.md in green and an untracked file called answers.md in red.

6) Now both files are in green with no commits yet.

7) After checking status the terminal shows On branch master with nothing to commit, working tree clean.

9) after inputing the commands the terminal says fatal:remote origin already exists. So I assume that the file is in my github. When i tryed to type in my password for github it says that "remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead."

10) The README.md was only updated in the web not in the local file.

11) When inputing the git push the terminal spits out a fatal: the current branch ain has no upstram branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use git push --set-upstream origin main.

12) The document did change when I used the pull input.

13) When ls -a is inputed into the computer ther terminal's output is . .. answers.md .git README.md
